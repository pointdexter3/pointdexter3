# Simplifi CSV Importer
🔭 I was recently inspired to create a [csv formatter](https://github.com/pointdexter3/simplifi-csv-formatter) for importing BA/CC csv files into the Simplifi budgeting app.

# Bulk import TODOIST project template files [(sync api V9)](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v9/#overview).

1. Creates a parent project.
2. Asks for project CSV template files.
3. Creates new projects based on the file names. 
4. Makes the new projects sub-projects of the parent project
5. Imports the tasks from the template CSV’s for each corresponding project


***Great for vacation checklists*** 🥰
