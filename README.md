# Simplifi OFX Importer
🔭 I was recently inspired to create a [OFX to Simplify CSV Converter](https://github.com/pointdexter3/simplifi-csv-formatter) for builk importing transactions into the Simplifi budgeting app.
- Applies to Simplifi Manual Accounts, for those that do not wish to share their FI credentials with 3rd parties. Interim solution until Canada's Open Banking is widely adopted.
- V1: Initial implementation was a trial of using chatgpt to help me work through things I was less familiar with (more advanced bash scripting, csv parsing / modification). to limited success (my expereince was that if the problem was non-trivial I would hit a wall of lies at maybe 70% of the solution)
- V2: Rewritten to use nodejs/typescript and parse FI's exported OFX standard files. OFX over the initial implementations CSV as the latter was wildly inconsistent between differents FI's and accounts.
