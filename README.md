# Simplifi OFX Importer
🔭 I was recently inspired to create a [OFX to Simplify CSV Converter](https://github.com/pointdexter3/simplifi-csv-formatter) for builk importing transactions into the Simplifi budgeting app.

# Bulk import TODOIST project template files [(sync api V9)](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v9/#overview).

1. Creates a parent project.
2. Asks for project CSV template files.
3. Creates new projects based on the file names. 
4. Makes the new projects sub-projects of the parent project
5. Imports the tasks from the template CSV’s for each corresponding project
